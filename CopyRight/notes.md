+ Determine how much of what you send to the Copyright Office will be code and how much will be screenshots.
+ As part of the processing for copyrighting software, you will have to send a hard copy deposit of your software to the Copyright Office.
+ Copyright Office presently has no designation for "computer software" as a type of work to be registered on its forms.
  + If your software is predominantly text-based, register it as a "literary work."
  + If your software uses a lot of pictures or graphics in its display, register it as a "visual arts work."
  + If your software uses a lot audio-visual components, such as .avi files, animated graphics or streaming video, register it as a "motion picture/audiovisual work."
+ Preregistration is designed to protect a work still in development from infringement. It does not replace registration, but it allows the developer to sue someone else for infringement that occurs before the final version is released or published
+ Once you pre-register your work, you must register it within 3 months after you publish or produce it or within a month after you become aware someone has infringed your copyright. If you don't register within this time, any court must dismiss a suit brought prior to or within the first 2 months after publication.
